# Getting started with Terraform on ELASTX OpenStack

This is a walkthrough from a clean tenant. We think you can use this as a boiler plate for several use-cases. What you will get:

* A network stack
* Bastion host where you can manage your infrastructure
* Web servers spread out over three availability zones with a Load Balancer
* Using terraform remote state to reference resources from earlier step

> We accept PRs for expanding and improve upon these examples
